# Recap Project 4: Activity & Weather App

This repository was made during my coding bootcamp. It contains an Activity & Weather App that was used to practice what I learned so far about React. It fetches weather data from an example API and displays activities to do according to if the weather is good or bad. The activities are custom made, stored in local storage and can be submitted through a form at the bottom.

## Disclaimer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
